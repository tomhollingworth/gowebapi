# Go Client for OSIsoft PI Web API

This is the Go programming language interface to PI Web API.

It was built against the **PI Web API 2018** specification.

## Installation

To compile Go programs you will need the [Go installation kit](https://golang.org/dl/).

Issue the following command to install this package:

```
go get -u github.com/mdrexel-osi/gowebapi
```

## Getting Started

Here is a sample Go program for retrieving the links from the Web API home page.  

Create a directory under `%GOPATH%` and let's call it `webapitest`.   Then create a new code file with the name `webapitest.go`

This will print all the version numbers of your PI Web API server plugins.  Replace the values in braces with the appropriate values for your environment.

```go
// webapitest.go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"

	pi "github.com/mdrexel-osi/gowebapi"
)

var cfg = pi.NewConfiguration()

var client *pi.APIClient
var auth context.Context

func Init() {
	cfg.BasePath = "https://{your web api server here}/piwebapi"

	auth = context.WithValue(context.Background(), pi.ContextBasicAuth, pi.BasicAuth{
		UserName: "{user name here}",
		Password: "{password here}",
	})

	client = pi.NewAPIClient(cfg)
}

func main() {
	Init()
	
	response, _, fail := client.SystemApi.SystemVersions(auth)
	if fail != nil {
		log.Fatal(fail)
	}

	fmt.Println("Here's all the plugin versions on PI Web API")
	for i := range response {
		fmt.Println(i, response[i].FullVersion)
	}
}
```

You can run the program by issuing the following commands

```
~/go/webapitest $ go build
~/go/webapitest $ ./webapitest
```

Your output should look something like this

```
~/go/webapitest $ ./webapitest 
Here's all the plugin versions on PI Web API
OSIsoft.REST.Documentation 1.11.0.967
OSIsoft.REST.Services 1.11.0.967
OSIsoft.Search.SvcLib 1.8.0.3651
OSIsoft.PIDirectory 1.0.0.0
OSIsoft.REST.Core 1.11.0.967
```

## Examples
I am keeping a cacce of example code to demonstrate how this client is used over in the [EXAMPLES.md](./EXAMPLES.md) page.

## Documentation for API Endpoints

If you'd like to read up on the Golang-specific data types that come back from this web client, [visit the documentation](/docs/README.md) under the `/docs` folder.

You can also use your own PI Web API server to read documentation by visiting your PI Web API server endpoint at `https://your.webapi.server/piwebapi` in any web browser.
